Dishonest Casino Example
------------------------

We'll use the ubiquitous dishonest casino example to demonstrate
how to train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on somewhat realistic
test data (e.g. http://www.mcb111.org/w06/durbin_book.pdf
Chapter 3).

In this example, we suspect that a casino is trading out a fair
die (singular or dice) for a loaded die. We want to figure out
1) when the loaded die was used (i.e. the most likely path) 2) how
often the loaded die is used (i.e. the transition probabilities) and
3) the probabilities for each outcome of a roll for the loaded die
(i.e. the emission probabilities).
